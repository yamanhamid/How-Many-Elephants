Unit Conversion and Reality Check API

This project provides a simple API for performing unit conversions and checking the realism of quantities using the Gemini language model.

Features

Unit Conversion: Converts between different units of measurement (e.g., meters to miles, grams to kilograms).
Reality Check: Leverages the Gemini language model to assess if a given quantity seems plausible and provides an explanation.
